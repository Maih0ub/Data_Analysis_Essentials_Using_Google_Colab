# 📊 Data Analysis Essentials Using Google Colab

### A Complete 3-Day Hands-On Project Covering Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

This repository contains a complete end-to-end learning and analysis project designed to build strong foundations in **data analysis using Python and Google Colab**.  
It starts from **Python fundamentals** and gradually advances to **real-world data exploration, visualization, and insights extraction** using a real dataset.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To master the fundamentals of Python and apply them in real-world data analysis workflows using `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

**Dataset Used:**  
`Sales_Transactions_3500.csv` — A dataset containing 3,500+ sales transactions including:
- Customer demographics  
- Purchase details  
- Product categories  
- Regional and payment information  

**Final Deliverable:**  
A Jupyter Notebook that walks through data exploration, visualization, and insights extraction — concluding with a summary report on **regional revenue distribution** and performance insights.
